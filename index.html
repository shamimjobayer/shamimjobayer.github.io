    <h2 style="text-align:center;color:green;">English Test</h2>
    <p style="color:green;font-weight:bold;">Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow:</p>
    <p>
        Most of our students cannot write out their 
        examination papers fairly. As they cannot understand 
        the questions properly, they often beat about the bush 
        and cram their answers with irrelevant and unnecessary 
        details. Sometimes they also fail to arrange their answer 
        neatly, cleanly and systemically. Although the teacher 
        suggests that their answer should be brief and precise, 
        they often lengthen them unnecessarily. Where size does not 
        matter at all, they have a silly notion that the more they 
        write, the more marks they will get. The reality is just 
        the opposite; their long answers generally become disgusting 
        and unsavory. Such answers always earn unhappy marks.

    <p>
        In order to get expected marks, all you should do, is to 
        understand the questions well and answer them just to 
        the point. Don't worry, if your answers are fairly short. 
        You should not play any time they may sound discordant. 
        Be sure your sentences make sense. Above all, you need a 
        neat presentation. To answer the short comprehensive 
        questions, you should not copy anything blindly from 
        the passage. Try to answer the questions more or less 
        in your own English. Frame your answers exactly in the 
        same tense and aspect on the questions are in. Don't 
        forget to write short and simple sentences. Plain and 
        clean English is not bad.
